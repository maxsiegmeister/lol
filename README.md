### About the repo

This is an amateur python coder's attempt at making it easier to find new music on Spotify using its API, without relying on recommendations from its algorithms. 

Have written a blog post about why I coded this up [here](http://shijith.com).

Go into some details of what you'll find in the repo, the script etc. Then go into the nitty-gritty

### Who this is for
* Amateur coders like myself who want to simplify how they find new music
* people who are unhappy with the songs Spotify recommendations for whatever reason
* 

### Getting started
Clone the repo with  
`git clone https://github.com/shijithpk/music-discovery.git`

Made extensive use of the spotipy [library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io) to access the Spotify API. Install the modules you'll need with  
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

THIS SCRIPT HOSTING BIT SHOULD BE AT THE END, AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE
### Where to host the script
I'm using Oracle Cloud's [free tier](https://www.oracle.com/in/cloud/free/), which offers two virtual machines for free forever. But you can use your cloud provider of choice--Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services etc.
